# SVG Logo Maker

## Description:
The application enables users to enter inputs into a inquirer prompt in order to generate a logo "logo.svg" file which contains the users desired results as an SVG image.


## The Challenge:
Build a Node.js command-line application that takes in user inputs to generates a SVG logo and saves it as "logo.svg" file. In addition, create a walkthrough video that demonstrates its functionality and the passing of all of the tests.

## Usage Instructions:
-Open the cloned repository in any source code editor e.g. Visual Studio Code.
-Open terminal
-Enter “node index.js” in the command line
-The user will be presented with questions - the user will provide a response to each question and proceed.
-Once completed a SVG file named "logo.svg" will be created.

## What was learned:
Through this project bootcamp students were introduced to SVG (Scalable Vector Graphic). We were taught how to use a test file using JavaScript, and testing it through the terminal by installing Jest, nmp i and running jest.
